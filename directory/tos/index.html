                ✦  This summary is for convenience only. The full Terms of Service below provides details.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>
            These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your access to and use of Cupid's Vault and any related
            experiences, websites, or services operated under Swagstakes (collectively, the “Service”).
            By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree,
            you must not use the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
            To operate Cupid's Vault fairly and securely, we collect limited information strictly for
            functionality, abuse prevention, and verification purposes:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Unique Device Identifier (UDI):</strong> A randomly generated identifier used to
                enforce participation limits and prevent abuse. This identifier does not reveal your
                device identity outside of our system.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Name:</strong> First name and last initial, required to participate. Names are
                stored in a hashed or otherwise obfuscated form and are not shared publicly or sold.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Data is retained only as long as reasonably necessary to operate the Service, resolve disputes,
            detect abuse, or comply with legal obligations. For additional details, please review our
            <a href="/cupids-vault/directory/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Eligibility</h3>
        <p>
            You must be at least <strong>13 years old</strong> to use the Service. By participating, you
            represent and warrant that you meet this requirement. No purchase or payment is required
            to participate.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Participation Limits & Fair Use</h3>
        <p>
            Participation is limited to <strong>one play per device</strong>. Any attempt to bypass,
            manipulate, or interfere with participation limits — including but not limited to using
            multiple devices, accounts, emulators, scripts, or modified identifiers — may result in
            disqualification, suspension, or permanent restriction from the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Results & Finality</h3>
        <p>
            All results are final once revealed. We are not responsible for outcomes affected by user
            error, connectivity interruptions, browser issues, or device-level failures. No rerolls,
            retries, or reversals will be provided unless explicitly stated by the organizer.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Prizes</h3>
        <p>
            Prizes, if offered, are awarded at the sole discretion of the organizer. Participation does not
            guarantee receipt of a prize. We reserve the right to verify eligibility and to deny, revoke,
            or reclaim prizes if fraud, abuse, rule violations, or technical errors are detected.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Technical Error:</strong> Any outcome or prize resulting from bugs, exploits,
            unintended behavior, or unauthorized interference with the Service. Such prizes are void
            unless explicitly honored by the organizer.
        </p>
        <p>
            Know what you can and cannot consume. Neither Swagstakes nor the organizer is responsible for
            repercussions that result from our prizes. We give all prize options in good faith, and it is
            the responsibility of the recipient to choose their prize responsibly.    
        </p>
        <h4>* RedBulls contain <b>Caffeine</b> and <b>Taurine</b>, among other ingredients that may produce adverse effects. Drink responsibly. It is not recommended to drink if you have any heart condition or have consumed more than 100mg of caffeine that day.</h4>

        <h3>6. Game Mechanics & Randomness</h3>
        <p>
            Cupid's Vault is a probability-based interactive experience. Outcomes are determined by
            randomized logic at the time you initiate play. Visual elements, including animations or
            spinning mechanics, are for presentation purposes only and <strong>do not influence the outcome</strong>.
            By participating, you acknowledge and accept the inherent randomness of the Service.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Modification, Suspension & Termination</h3>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to modify, suspend, restrict, or discontinue the Service (or any part
            thereof) at any time, with or without notice, for any reason. Users found to be in violation
            of these Terms may have access suspended or permanently terminated.
        </p>

        <h3>8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, Swagstakes shall not be liable for any indirect,
            incidental, consequential, or punitive damages arising from your use of the Service,
            including but not limited to lost opportunities, prizes, or data.
        </p>

        <h3>9. Acceptance of Terms</h3>
        <p>
            By accessing or using Cupid's Vault, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agreed
            to these Terms. Continued use of the Service constitutes ongoing acceptance of any updates
            or modifications.
