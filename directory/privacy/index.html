            This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, why we collect it, how it is used,
            and the choices you have regarding your data when using Cupid's Vault and related services
            (collectively, the “Service”).
        </p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>
            We collect only the minimum identifiable information necessary to operate Cupid's Vault fairly, securely,
            and as intended:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Unique Device Identifier (UDI):</strong> A randomly generated identifier used to
                enforce participation limits and prevent abuse. This identifier does not reveal your
                identity or device details outside of our systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Name:</strong> Your first name and last initial, required to participate.
                Names are stored in a hashed or otherwise obfuscated format and are never sold or shared
                publicly.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
        <p>

            <li>Verifying eligibility for prizes or promotions.</li>
            <li>Detecting, preventing, and investigating abuse, fraud, or technical misuse.</li>
            <li>Responding to inquiries, disputes, or legal obligations.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Information Sharing</h3>
        <p>

            <li>When required by law, legal process, or governmental request.</li>
            <li>To enforce our Terms of Service or protect the rights, safety, and integrity of the Service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Internally, aggregated or anonymized data may be used to improve system performance,
            fairness, and reliability. This data does not identify individual users.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
        <p>
            We retain identifiable information only for as long as reasonably necessary to operate the Service,
            investigate issues, enforce our policies, or comply with legal requirements. When identifiable information
            is no longer required, it is securely deleted or anonymized.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Security</h3>
        <p>
            We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and organizational safeguards to protect
            your information. This includes encryption of sensitive data, secure storage practices, and
            restricted internal access. However, no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee
            absolute protection against all risks.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <p>
