        <h1>Swagstakes — Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h2>Cupid's Vault · Last Updated: January 27, 2026</h2>

        <p class="privacy-text">
            Swagstakes (“we”, “our”, or “us”) respects your privacy and is committed to protecting it. This Privacy Policy explains the types of information we collect from users of Swagstakes and how that information is used, stored, and protected.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
        <p class="privacy-text">
            When you access or play any Swagstakes games, we collect certain information to operate and secure the Service:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unique Device Identifier (UDI)</strong> — a randomly generated identifier used to enforce the one-play-per-device rule. This ID does not personally identify you outside of our platform.</li>
            <li><strong>Name</strong> — your first name and last initial, which is required to access the Service and for verification purposes. Names are hashed and are never shared outside our organization except as required by law.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. How We Use Your Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To manage gameplay and enforce limits on device participation.</li>
            <li>To verify eligibility for prizes and compliance with rules.</li>
            <li>To prevent abuse, fraud, and unauthorized manipulation of the Service.</li>
            <li>To respond to disputes, inquiries, or legal requirements.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Information Sharing</h3>
        <p class="privacy-text">
            We do not sell or share your personal information with third parties. Information may be disclosed only when:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Required by law, legal process, or government authorities.</li>
            <li>Necessary to enforce our Terms of Service or protect the rights, property, or safety of Swagstakes, our users, or the public.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p class="privacy-text">
            Internally, we may use information collected from your device to improve our services and the experience we offer. This information is not shared outside of our organization, and generally is not personally identifying without
            access to other encrypted information.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
        <p class="privacy-text">
            We retain your information only as long as necessary to operate the Service, resolve disputes, enforce our policies, and comply with legal obligations.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Security</h3>
        <p class="privacy-text">
            We implement technical and organizational measures to safeguard the information we collect. This includes encryption for sensitive data, secure server storage, and internal access controls. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or storage system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
        </p>

        <h3>6. Children’s Privacy</h3>
        <p class="privacy-text">
            Cupid's Vault is intended for users 13 years or older. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we learn that we have collected information from a child under 13, we will delete it promptly.
        </p>

        <h3>7. Your Rights</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You may request access to the personal information we hold about you.</li>
            <li>You may request that your information be corrected or deleted where applicable.</li>
            <li>To exercise these rights, please contact us via our <a href="/frosty-fortune">Contact Page</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>8. Updates to This Policy</h3>
        <p class="privacy-text">
            We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. Changes will be reflected by the “Last Updated” date above. We encourage you to review this Policy periodically for any updates.
